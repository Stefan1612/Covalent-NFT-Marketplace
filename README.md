## Approach

A NFT Marketplace running currently on Kovan. Let's you mint, sell and buy NFT's. During the minting we store the Metadata on IPFS and only store the TokenURI on-chain.

## What is a NFT Marketplace?

This DApp allows you mint, buy and sell NFT's from the "Ape Family" contract.

- NFT's uploaded to IPFS
- Generated Transfer History with Covalent API, ethers receipt, tokenURI
- sell, buy with NFT Marketplace contract
- mint, transfer and set TokenURI with NFT contract

## Covalent API
